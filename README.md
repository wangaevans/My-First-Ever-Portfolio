# FUN PROJECT: Portfolio

This project serves as a showcase of my skills, this was at the end of 2021. Although it's still a work in progress, I'm excited to share my journey as I continue to develop and enhance it.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Plans

While this version of websiteo is built using traditional web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), I plan to enhance it further by integrating modern frameworks such as React or Vue.js. This will not only improve the overall user experience but also allow for better scalability and maintainability of the project.
